> ### Google Cloud Platform (Datastore + Cloud Functions) serverless codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld API Spec](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/api).

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Google Cloud Platform (Datastore + Cloud Functions)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to community style guides & best practices.
